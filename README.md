# Cardiovascular_disease_prediction
This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease. By analyzing a wide range of health metrics and lifestyle factors, we seek to create a reliable and accurate prediction model. The goal is to identify individuals at higher risk early on, enabling timely intervention and preventive measures.
