# Cardiovascular_disease_prediction
This project focuses on predicting cardiovascular disease using a linear regression model. We utilized a dataset from Kaggle to develop our predictive analytics. By applying advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms, we aimed to enhance early detection and risk assessment of cardiovascular conditions. This project not only showcases the power of data-driven insights but also contributes to the broader effort of improving healthcare outcomes through predictive modeling.
